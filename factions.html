            <p>The Hognauts, descendants of the genetically enhanced pigs of Earth's past, have assumed the mantle of galactic rulers. 
            With an air of entitlement and elitism, their society is a beacon of opulence and extravagance, fueled by their insatiable
            consumerist desires. Ruled by a self-appointed royal family, they view themselves as the rightful stewards of the galaxy, their
            expansionist ambitions driven by a conviction that they alone can bring about the "betterment of all." Armed with
            overwhelming military might, they conquer planets and exploit resources with ruthless efficiency, their rapid population growth
