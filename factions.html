            <p>The Hognauts, descendants of the genetically enhanced pigs of Earth's past, have assumed the mantle of galactic rulers. 
            With an air of entitlement and elitism, their society is a beacon of opulence and extravagance, fueled by their insatiable
            consumerist desires. Ruled by a self-appointed royal family, they view themselves as the rightful stewards of the galaxy, their
            expansionist ambitions driven by a conviction that they alone can bring about the "betterment of all." Armed with
            overwhelming military might, they conquer planets and exploit resources with ruthless efficiency, their rapid population growth
            ensuring a constant stream of soldiers to fuel their conquests.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p>The AstroChimps, also modified by the same genetic experiments, are the descendants of chimpanzees sent into space 
            during humanity's Cold War era and survived. They thrived among the stars and colonized many worlds. Now envious 
            of the Hognauts' power and ungrateful inheritance of Earth, their rightful home, they strive to rebel against the pig's 
            expansion. They embody cunning and ingenuity.
            Utilizing guerrilla tactics and scavenging for resources, they wage a relentless war against their swine opposition.
            Their inventive nature and knack for adaptation make them formidable opponents. As they fight for their place in the 
            galaxy, they strive to reclaim the legacy humanity left behind. </p>
