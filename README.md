## Introduction

The Ham Galaxy Portal is a website for all things Ham Galaxy. News, Lore, Community, Shopping, and of course the game itself. 
This is primarily a portfolio project and should not be taken too seriously. If I ever develop the Ham Galaxy Game, which 
currently I don't have time to do, then I will flesh the site out a bit more and truly make it a hub. For now, 
take a look and let me know if you have any thoughts and suggestions on how to improve it.


## Features

- Responsive design (mostly)
- Slide out info boxes for factions
- Registration page with form linked to mailchimp
- (currently) Quake 3 submodule just for fun (I take no ownership of this and credit goes to those who made that game possible)
- Live on custom domain hamgalaxy.com (because why not?)
