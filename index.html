            <h1>Join the Fight!</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>In the 1960s, during a turbulent era of scientific experimentation, humans embarked on a venture that would forever
                alter the course of evolution on Earth. In their relentless pursuit of enhancing human intelligence, scientists
                conducted controversial experiments on both pigs and chimpanzees, utilizing a serum designed to accelerate cognitive
                development. These experiments, however, appeared to be colossal failures at the time, as the expected results did not
                materialize as anticipated.
                <br><br> 
                Unknown to humanity, the intelligence serum had not failed entirely; rather, its effects were far subtler and much
                slower than expected. Unbeknownst to humans, this serum had subtly altered the genetic code of the test subjects,
                setting in motion a transformation that would span countless generations.
                <br><br>
                As the serum-induced genetic changes manifested, the affected pigs and chimps began to exhibit signs of heightened
                intelligence over the course of hundreds of generations. Their cognitive abilities expanded at an astonishing rate, far
                surpassing the natural evolution that humans had undergone. While humanity descended into self-destructive conflicts,
                driven by wars and a disheartening trend of breeding intellectual mediocrity, the pigs and chimps in the shadows
                underwent a silent transformation.
                <br><br>
                By the time humanity had reached its inevitable demise, leaving the Earth scarred and depleted, the descendants of those
                experimentally altered pigs and chimps emerged as the most advanced species on the planet. The pigs, carrying the
                genetic legacy of those 1960s experiments, now possessed unparalleled intelligence, while the AstroChimps, who had been
                sent into space with the altered gene, had similarly evolved into hyper-intelligent beings.

            <p>
                In the year 2777 CE, the Earth had become a very different place. The humans were gone, their once-mighty civilization
                reduced to dust by their own folly. In their place stood the intelligent pigs and the AstroChimps, the nearest genetic
                relatives of the former rulers of Earth. With their exceptional intellect and advanced technologies, they had not only
                inherited the Earth but had also expanded their dominion into the far reaches of the galaxy.
                <br><br>
                Despite their shared genetic heritage and the altered gene that had shaped their destinies, negotiations between the two
                species ultimately broke down. The AstroChimps were resolute in their belief that they were the rightful heirs to Earth,
                spurred on by a sense of genetic heritage and destiny.
                <br><br>
                War was declared, and it soon spilled beyond the confines of Earth. Both the hyper-intelligent pigs and AstroChimps
                wielded futuristic technology, turning distant planets and star systems into battlegrounds as they fiercely competed for
                dominance in the cosmos.
                <br><br>
                Their struggle, rooted in the genetic experiments of the 1960s, symbolized the unpredictable and profound consequences
                of human scientific curiosity. It was a battle for supremacy that transcended Earth's boundaries and would ultimately
                determine the fate of countless worlds and the legacy of two species born from the remnants of human ambition.
                <br><br>
                In this epic tale of evolution, conflict, and ambition, the hyper-intelligent pigs and AstroChimps emerged as the
                unintended, extraordinary products of humanity's past experiments, forging a new era in intergalactic history. The
                battle for control of habitable worlds had begun, its outcome shrouded in the mysteries of genetic manipulation and the
                complex web of evolution.
                <br><br>
                Today, the Hognauts and Astrochimps and their various alliances engage in epic space battles throughout the galaxy, as
                they expand their reaches, contesting habitable worlds and resources and attempting to outpace each otherâ€™s technology.
